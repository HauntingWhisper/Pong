# Clawthorne-G300-Week4
I added a multiball, so when someone hits a certain thing more balls appear.
Along with the core stuff I needed to do.
I alsomade the controls WS for left and Up and Down arrow keys for right

For the second half I added UI and Menu screen, along with particald. I got some soundbytes of the freesound site you attched. I wanted some sounds that fit the 80s arcade/lazer tag feel but I think the ones i choose fir well enough, was going to add backgroundmusic but I didntknow what to do and was running out of time.
